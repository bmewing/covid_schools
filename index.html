        <p style="text-align:center">
            <strong>Thank you to the courageous BOE members Jim Welch (President), Carrie Upshaw and Eric Hyche!</strong>
            The BOE approved the KCS operating manual with the clarification that during period of 'substantial spread'
            (the red zone) education will be virtual.

        <h2>Scenario Calculations</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <strong>There are <span id="days_till_school"></span> days until school.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If every day from now till then had 0 cases, the 14-day average confirmed rate would be <span id="all_zero"></span>, <span id="all_zero_no_senior"></span>.<br/>
            If every day was instead 7.5 (squarely in yellow), the average confirmed rate would be <span id="seven_point_five"></span>, <span id="seven_no_senior"></span>.<br/>
            Finally, if every day was instead 4.5 (high green), the average confirmed rate would be <span id="four_point_five"></span> <span id="four_no_senior"></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="child_corr"></span>% of the variation observed in the school aged children case rate
            can be explained by the general population's case rate - children are not isolated or immune from the virus.

        <h2>
            Where does the data come from?
        </h2>
        <p>
            All data you see here <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/" target="_blank">Tennessee Department of Health</a> website.
            Specifically, the New Rate and Confirmed Rate are available as a
            <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html" target="_blank">downloadable Excel file</a>
            which is updated daily (County New and County School are the files used here). This source is important because
            as stated on the <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/data-faqs.html" target="_blank">Data FAQ</a>
            when the data is provided by the state, cases are counted by their county of residence. They go on to state
            that data reported by the county may include cases that are being treated in county, but that is <strong>not</strong>
            where this data comes from.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only data not available directly as a downloadable file is the count of nursing home patients. This still
            comes from the TN Department of Health on the
            <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/clusters-in-long-term-care-facilities.html" target="_blank">Clusters in Long Term Care Facilities</a>
            page and this site access it through the API used there. Please note, the API is not publicly exposed but
            can be discovered by looking at the code powering that page. It is not clear how often this data is updated
            or reported, but because it comes from the same source of truth as the rest of the data on this page, it would
            be the most reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Population values come from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sullivancountytennessee/PST045219" target="_blank">US Census Bureau</a>
            for Sullivan County.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How is the Confirmed Rate higher than the New Rate?
        </h2>
        <p>
            New Cases is the sum of Confirmed Cases and Probable Cases. Suspected Cases are individuals who do not have a positive
            PCR test but meet certain <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/data-faqs.html", target="_blank">criteria</a>.
            These cases can be confirmed negative with a PCR test and are reflected as
            a negative value. What this means is one day could have 2 Probable Cases (new cases=2) and a week later these are confirmed
            negative (new cases=-2). If on the same day the probable cases are confirmed negative there are 2 Confirmed cases, the
            new case count would be 0 (2 confirmed, -2 negative probable) but the confirmed count would still be 2. This
            is exactly how the TN Department of Health reports their numbers.

            Why all the extra adjustments?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, members of the Kingsport BOE are
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amy.ewing.7564/posts/1671796949646073" target="_blank">making wild claims</a>
            about the data.<br/>
            <div style="text-align:center"><img src="img/boe_quote.png"></div>
            They further claim the state level data is
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/melissa.golden/posts/10220787837757349" target="_blank">"flawed" and "incredibly suspect."</a><br/>
            <div style="text-align:center"><img src="img/boe_quote2.png"></div>
            <div style="text-align:center"><img src="img/boe_quote3.png"></div>
            It is unfortunate that leaders are attempting to gaslight the population
            into believing that the data is unreliable. To that end, we are now including adjustments to all calcuations
            to be based primarily on confirmed cases and to make incredibly
            naive adjustments for nursing home resident cases (despite
            <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767750?guestAccessKey=a449edec-a032-4386-98f4-3ebfce1366f6" target="_blank">research from Harvard</a>
            suggesting the mortality rate of nursing homes mirrors that of the general population) assuming all active
            cases occurred in the last 14 days and without adjusting the total population to remove nursing home residents.
            The only claim made by BOE members that cannot be accounted for is in the jailed population and that is only
            because the data is unavailable.

        <h2>
            What is the School Aged Children Rate?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Rather than beat around the bush, why not look at school aged children in our region? The State of Tennessee
            provides case count (unclear if confirmed or if it includes suspected) for children aged 5-18. We can calculate
            the population of the county that is 5-18 (22,643) and calculate a rate just for them. Data only started being
            reported in this category on July 18, 2020, so there is no 14-day average available, instead, the daily rate
            is shown above.
        </p>
        <h2>
            I thought kids were immune/resistant/non-spreaders?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A lot has been said about how kids aren't super-spreaders, they're less likely to contract the disease, they're less
            likely to get sick from the disease, and they're less likely to die from the disease. In fact, this is the primary
            mantra behind the re-open schools camp. The reality is that we don't know - schools were shut down very quickly
            preventing observation of an environment that is well known for spreading respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses,
            KCS shut down in March when cases were very rare and almost no spread was occurring in Sullivan County. As other countries
            have reopened, they have not seen major outbreaks centered around schools and that is used as evidence of the
            special status kids have. However, those countries have done a significantly better job of 'flattening the curve'
            and stopping the spread of illness in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            From July 28 to July 28, cases in school aged children increased by 33% across Tennessee, growing from 6,827 to
            9,085 (<a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/covid-19-infections-jump-33-in-just-10-days-among-tennessee-children" target="_blank">Related Article</a>).
            <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2768952" target="_blank">New research published on July 30</a>
            provides evidence that while kids under 5 are less likely to become symptomatic,
            their upper respiratory systems carry 10-100x the viral load of older kids or adults who carry the virus.
            While this doesn't establish or prove that they are 'super spreaders', it is established in literature and
            common understanding that kids spread respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, why would COVID be fundamentally
            different? Even data for Sullivan County shows the case rate for school aged children spikes when the general population
            spikes and on July 30 even exceed the general population rate (22 vs 21.5 per 100,000).
